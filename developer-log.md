# Developer Log

## 2024-03-19 - Improved Claude Integration and Logging

### Changes Made
1. Created dedicated service classes for better encapsulation:
   - `ClaudeService`: Handles all Claude API interactions
   - `MapService`: Encapsulates map command execution
   - Added logging utilities for consistent log formatting

2. Updated proxy server:
   - Using latest Anthropic API endpoint (/v1/messages)
   - Added comprehensive request/response logging
   - Proper CORS and error handling

3. Refactored Chat component:
   - Moved Claude API logic to dedicated service
   - Improved error handling and loading states
   - Added message timestamps
   - Optimized rendering with useMemo and useCallback

### Current Status
- Basic chat functionality with Claude integration
- Map command parsing and execution
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

   - Created utility functions for type-safe GeoJSON conversions
   - Implemented proper feature ID management
   - Added support for all GeoJSON geometry types

2. Implemented layer management system:
   - Created LayerService for centralized layer state management
   - Added support for layer groups and feature collections
   - Implemented layer visibility and style controls

3. Enhanced map command system:
   - Added type-safe command interfaces
   - Implemented command execution with proper error handling
   - Added logging for all map operations

4. Updated MapComponent:
   - Added layer group initialization
   - Implemented feature manipulation methods
   - Added proper cleanup on unmount

## 2024-03-19 - Spatial Analysis Features

### Changes Made
1. Added Turf.js integration:
   - Installed and configured @turf/turf package
   - Created SpatialService for analysis operations
   - Added type-safe geometry handling

2. Implemented measurement features:
   - Distance calculations between features
   - Area calculations for polygons
   - Proper unit conversions and formatting

3. Added geometry operations:
   - Buffer creation with configurable distance
   - Geometry simplification
   - Centroid calculation
   - Bounding box computation

4. Enhanced MapComponent:
   - Integrated spatial analysis methods
   - Added buffer visualization
   - Improved feature handling

### Current Status
- Spatial analysis features operational
- Layer management system complete
- Type-safe GeoJSON handling

### Next Steps
1. Implement measurement UI:
   - Create MeasurementControl component
   ```typescript
   interface MeasurementControlProps {
     onMeasureStart: (type: 'distance' | 'area') => void;
     onMeasureEnd: () => void;
     isActive: boolean;
   }
   ```
   - Add measurement mode toggle
   - Display measurement results
   - Add unit selection

2. Create buffer analysis UI:
   - Implement BufferControl component
   ```typescript
   interface BufferControlProps {
     onBufferCreate: (distance: number, units: string) => void;
     selectedFeature?: GeoJSONFeature;
   }
   ```
   - Add distance input
   - Add unit selection
   - Show preview

3. Add layer management UI:
   - Create LayerControl component
   ```typescript
   interface LayerControlProps {
     layers: LayerGroup[];
     onLayerToggle: (layerId: string, visible: boolean) => void;
     onLayerStyle: (layerId: string, style: L.PathOptions) => void;
   }
   ```
   - Show layer hierarchy
   - Add visibility toggles
   - Add style controls

4. Implement feature editing:
   - Add EditControl component
   - Support geometry editing
   - Add property editor
   - Handle feature updates

### Technical Debt
- Add error boundaries for UI components
- Implement unit tests for spatial operations
- Add input validation for measurements
- Consider performance optimizations for large datasets
- Add documentation for spatial analysis features

### Notes
- All spatial operations properly logged
- Error handling in place
- Type safety maintained
- Services properly encapsulated
- UI components needed for user interaction
