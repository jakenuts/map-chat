# Developer Log

## 2024-03-19 - Improved Claude Integration and Logging

### Changes Made
1. Created dedicated service classes for better encapsulation:
   - `ClaudeService`: Handles all Claude API interactions
   - `MapService`: Encapsulates map command execution
   - Added logging utilities for consistent log formatting

2. Updated proxy server:
   - Using latest Anthropic API endpoint (/v1/messages)
   - Added comprehensive request/response logging
   - Proper CORS and error handling

3. Refactored Chat component:
   - Moved Claude API logic to dedicated service
   - Improved error handling and loading states
   - Added message timestamps
   - Optimized rendering with useMemo and useCallback

### Current Status
- Basic chat functionality with Claude integration
- Map command parsing and execution
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 2024-03-19 - Map Layer Management Implementation

### Changes Made
1. Added GeoJSON feature handling:
   - Created utility functions for type-safe GeoJSON conversions
   - Implemented proper feature ID management
   - Added support for all GeoJSON geometry types

2. Implemented layer management system:
   - Created LayerService for centralized layer state management
   - Added support for layer groups and feature collections
   - Implemented layer visibility and style controls

3. Enhanced map command system:
   - Added type-safe command interfaces
   - Implemented command execution with proper error handling
   - Added logging for all map operations

4. Updated MapComponent:
   - Added layer group initialization
   - Implemented feature manipulation methods
   - Added proper cleanup on unmount

### Current Status
- Layer management system operational
- GeoJSON feature handling complete
- Map command system ready for extension

### Next Steps
1. Implement spatial analysis features:
   - Add Turf.js integration for measurements
   - Implement buffer creation
   - Add distance calculations
   - Support area measurements

2. Add user interface improvements:
   - Create layer control panel
   - Add feature property editor
   - Implement style editor
   - Add measurement tools UI

3. Enhance data management:
   - Add KML import/export
   - Implement feature persistence
   - Add undo/redo functionality
   - Support feature history

### Technical Debt
- Need to add proper error boundaries
- Consider adding unit tests for services
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all components
- Add input validation for map commands
- Consider adding E2E tests for critical paths

### Notes
- Current implementation follows React best practices
- Services are properly encapsulated
- Type safety is maintained throughout
- Logging system provides good debugging capabilities
