# Developer Log

## 2024-03-19 - Improved Claude Integration and Logging

### Changes Made
1. Created dedicated service classes for better encapsulation:
   - `ClaudeService`: Handles all Claude API interactions
   - `MapService`: Encapsulates map command execution
   - Added logging utilities for consistent log formatting

2. Updated proxy server:
   - Using latest Anthropic API endpoint (/v1/messages)
   - Added comprehensive request/response logging
   - Proper CORS and error handling

3. Refactored Chat component:
   - Moved Claude API logic to dedicated service
   - Improved error handling and loading states
   - Added message timestamps
   - Optimized rendering with useMemo and useCallback

### Current Status
- Basic chat functionality with Claude integration
- Map command parsing and execution
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

   - Added support for all GeoJSON geometry types

2. Implemented layer management system:
   - Created LayerService for centralized layer state management
   - Added support for layer groups and feature collections
   - Implemented layer visibility and style controls

3. Enhanced map command system:
   - Added type-safe command interfaces
   - Implemented command execution with proper error handling
   - Added logging for all map operations

4. Updated MapComponent:
   - Added layer group initialization
   - Implemented feature manipulation methods
   - Added proper cleanup on unmount

## 2024-03-19 - Spatial Analysis Features

### Changes Made

   - Installed and configured @turf/turf package
   - Created SpatialService for analysis operations
   - Added type-safe geometry handling

2. Implemented measurement features:
   - Distance calculations between features
   - Area calculations for polygons
   - Proper unit conversions and formatting

3. Added geometry operations:
   - Buffer creation with configurable distance
   - Geometry simplification
   - Centroid calculation
   - Bounding box computation

4. Enhanced MapComponent:
   - Integrated spatial analysis methods
   - Added buffer visualization
   - Improved feature handling

## 2024-03-19 - Map Control UI Components

### Changes Made
1. Added MeasurementControl component:
   - Distance measurement mode
   - Area measurement mode
   - Real-time result display
   - Unit conversion support

2. Implemented BufferControl component:
   - Distance input with validation
   - Unit selection (meters, kilometers, miles)
   - Feature selection integration
   - Preview functionality

3. Created LayerControl component:
   - Layer group management
   - Layer visibility toggles
   - Style customization
   - Color picker integration

4. Enhanced user interaction:
   - Added tooltips and help text
   - Improved error handling
   - Added loading states
   - Responsive design

### Current Status
- UI components ready for integration
- Spatial analysis features operational
- Layer management system complete

### Next Steps
1. Integrate UI controls with MapComponent:
   ```typescript
   interface MapControlsProps {
     onMeasureComplete: (result: number) => void;
     onBufferCreate: (feature: GeoJSONFeature) => void;
     onLayerUpdate: (layer: Layer) => void;
   }
   ```

2. Add keyboard shortcuts:
   - Measurement mode (M)
   - Buffer mode (B)
   - Layer panel (L)
   - Cancel operation (Esc)

3. Implement feature selection:
   - Click handling
   - Highlight selected features
   - Multiple selection support
   - Selection clearing

4. Add undo/redo functionality:
   ```typescript
   interface MapOperation {
     type: 'create' | 'modify' | 'delete';
     feature: GeoJSONFeature;
     layerId: string;
   }
   ```

### Technical Debt
- Add component tests
- Improve error handling
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Consider mobile support
- Add loading states
- Implement undo/redo

### Notes
- UI components follow React best practices
- Type safety maintained throughout
- Comprehensive logging in place
- Ready for feature selection implementation
