     const {
       mode,
       selectedFeatures,
       startMeasurement,
       // ...other mode handlers
     } = useMapMode();

     const {
       handleFeatureClick,
       isFeatureSelected,
       // ...other selection handlers
     } = useMapSelection({ map });

     const { getShortcutHint } = useMapShortcuts({
       onMeasure: () => startMeasurement('distance'),
       // ...other shortcut handlers
     });

     // Component implementation
   };
   ```

2. Add undo/redo system:
