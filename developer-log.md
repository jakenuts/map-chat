## 2024-01-04 - Claude Integration Issues & SDK Migration

### Issues Discovered
1. Custom Claude API Integration Problems:
   - Initially used custom fetch implementation causing 504 timeout errors
   - Incorrect API version headers ('2024-01-01' vs '2023-06-01')
   - Manual request/response handling prone to errors
   - Lack of proper type safety for API requests/responses

2. Proxy Server Challenges:
   - Path rewriting issues (/api/messages â†’ /v1/messages)
   - Timeout configuration problems
   - Error handling inadequacies
   - Logging limitations

### Critical Insight
- Discovered we weren't utilizing the official @anthropic-ai/sdk package
- Custom implementation missed important API features and type safety
- Unnecessary complexity in proxy server implementation

### Action Items Completed
1. Migrated to Official SDK:
   - Installed @anthropic-ai/sdk
   - Removed custom fetch implementation
   - Updated ClaudeService to use SDK
   - Implemented proper type safety
   - Added proper system message handling
   - Fixed environment variable configuration
   - Added browser support with dangerouslyAllowBrowser option

2. Removed Proxy Server:
   - Eliminated unnecessary proxy layer
   - Simplified architecture
   - Reduced potential points of failure
   - Improved error handling

3. Testing Implementation:
   - Created test-claude-sdk.ts for direct SDK testing
   - Verified API communication works
   - Confirmed proper message handling
   - Validated system message integration

### Environment Configuration
1. Browser Environment:
   - Switched from process.env to import.meta.env for Vite compatibility
   - Added dangerouslyAllowBrowser flag for client-side SDK usage
   - Updated environment variable naming (VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

2. Development Setup:
   - Simplified start script to use Vite only
   - Removed proxy server dependencies
   - Updated test scripts for SDK usage

### Current Status
1. SDK Integration:
   - Successfully integrated @anthropic-ai/sdk
   - Proper message format handling
   - Correct environment variable setup
   - Type-safe implementation
   - Browser-compatible configuration

2. Testing Results:
   - Direct SDK communication working
   - Proper response handling
   - System messages working
   - Error handling improved
   - Browser integration verified

### Technical Notes
- SDK version: @anthropic-ai/sdk@0.33.1
- Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
- API version: 2023-06-01
- Environment variable: VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- Browser support: Enabled with dangerouslyAllowBrowser

### Improvements Made
1. Code Quality:
   - Proper TypeScript types
   - Better error handling
   - Improved logging
   - Clean architecture
   - Browser compatibility

2. Developer Experience:
   - Simplified setup
   - Better testing tools
   - Improved documentation
   - Clear error messages
   - Direct SDK usage

### Lessons Learned
1. Always check for official SDKs first
2. Maintain proper documentation
3. Use type safety from the start
4. Test thoroughly before implementation
5. Consider browser environment requirements early
6. Keep architecture simple when possible
7. Properly handle environment variables per platform
