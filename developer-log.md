## 2024-03-19 - Improved Claude Integration and Logging

### Changes Made
1. Created dedicated service classes for better encapsulation:
   - `ClaudeService`: Handles all Claude API interactions
   - `MapService`: Encapsulates map command execution
   - Added logging utilities for consistent log formatting

2. Updated proxy server:
   - Using latest Anthropic API endpoint (/v1/messages)
   - Added comprehensive request/response logging
   - Proper CORS and error handling

3. Refactored Chat component:
   - Moved Claude API logic to dedicated service
   - Improved error handling and loading states
   - Added message timestamps
   - Optimized rendering with useMemo and useCallback

### Current Status
- Basic chat functionality with Claude integration
- Map command parsing and execution
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Next Steps
1. Implement map visualization features:
   - Layer management
   - Feature styling
   - Measurement tools
   - Buffer analysis

2. Add user experience improvements:
   - Message persistence
   - Loading indicators
   - Error recovery
   - Input validation

3. Enhance map commands:
   - Support for complex GeoJSON features
   - Additional spatial operations
   - Custom styling options

### Technical Debt
- Need to add proper error boundaries
- Consider adding unit tests for services
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all components
- Add input validation for map commands
